# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Session Start

**Read this file completely at the start of every session before taking any action.**

## Safety Rules

Do NOT change without explicit instruction and confirmation first:

- **Auth flow** (`AuthModule`, `JwtAuthGuard`, `PermissionsGuard`, JWT payload shape) — every route in the app depends on the current token contract; a silent change locks out users or opens routes.
- **Prisma schema migrations** — always use the manual workaround in Commands above; never run destructive migration commands (`migrate reset`, `db push --force-reset`).
- **Global bootstrap wiring in `main.ts`** (`ValidationPipe`, `PrismaExceptionFilter`, `ResponseFormatInterceptor`, `APP_GUARD` registrations) — these are cross-cutting; breaking one breaks every endpoint's response shape or auth behavior at once.
- **RBAC seed data** (`roles`, `permissions`, `RolePermission` mappings in seed script) — changing names/keys here desyncs already-issued JWTs (permissions are baked into the token, not re-checked against DB).
- **`BinStock` / `Inventory` invariant** (`SUM(BinStock.quantity WHERE warehouseId=W) === Inventory.quantity WHERE warehouseId=W`) — any stock-mutation code must preserve this; breaking it corrupts reported stock silently.

If a change requires touching any of the above, state clearly what and why, and wait for confirmation before implementing.

## Code Documentation Conventions

Document the **why**, never the **what** — well-named identifiers already say what code does; a comment earns its place only when the reader can't derive it from the code itself.

- **Document**: non-obvious business rules/invariants, design decisions with real trade-offs, workarounds for a specific bug/limitation, concurrency/locking rationale, non-obvious algorithms or formats (e.g. zero-padding for lexicographic order), anything that would genuinely surprise a future reader.
- **Don't document**: trivial CRUD, simple getters/destructuring, self-explanatory conditionals, anything a competent reader infers instantly from names/types.
- **Style**: short inline `//` comments in **Spanish** (matches existing comments across the codebase) for business-logic explanations; JSDoc only on exported functions/classes whose behavior isn't obvious from the signature — never on trivial ones. No multi-paragraph comment blocks.
- **Before adding a comment**, check the surrounding code for one that already explains the same thing — don't duplicate.
- This is a comment-only concern — never justifies changing logic, renaming, or refactoring as a side effect of "documenting."

## Project Overview

ERP Supply Chain — full-stack application for managing products, inventory, warehouses, customers, suppliers, accounts receivable/payable, and documents.

- **Backend**: NestJS REST API (`backend/`)
- **Frontend**: React SPA named **EloSC** (`frontend/`), brand colors `#141a17` primary / `#07bc34` secondary

## Commands

All commands run from the `backend/` directory using `pnpm`. See `backend/package.json` scripts for the full list.

> **Migration workaround** — `migrate:dev` needs an interactive terminal and fails in Claude Code. Use instead:
> 1. `pnpm exec prisma migrate diff --config prisma/prisma.config.ts --from-config-datasource --to-schema prisma/schema.prisma --script` → get SQL
> 2. Create `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql` manually with that SQL
> 3. `pnpm exec prisma migrate deploy --config prisma/prisma.config.ts` → apply
> 4. `pnpm exec prisma generate --config prisma/prisma.config.ts` → regenerate client

## Architecture

### Module Structure

**Bootstrap** (`main.ts`):

- Global `ValidationPipe` for DTO validation
- Global `PrismaExceptionFilter` — catches Prisma errors P2002/P2003/P2025 and returns Spanish-language HTTP errors
- Global `ResponseFormatInterceptor` — wraps all responses as `{ success, data }`
- Listens on `PORT` env var (default 3000)

**AppModule** imports: `ConfigModule` (global, reads `.env`), `AuthModule`, `PrismaModule`, `ThirdPartiesModule`, `ProductsModule`, `WarehousesModule`, `DocumentsModule`, `AccountsPayableModule`, `AccountsReceivableModule`

**PrismaModule** is global — inject `PrismaService` anywhere without re-importing the module.

**AuthModule**:

- `GET /auth` — list all users with roles; requires `user.manage`
- `GET /auth/roles` — list all active roles with their permissions; requires `user.manage`
- `POST /auth` — create user (requires name, username, password, roleIds[]); requires `user.manage`
- `PATCH /auth/:id` — update user (password and roleIds optional); requires `user.manage`. When `password` is present it's bcrypt-hashed (10 salt rounds, same as create) before the `user.update` call — never written in plaintext
- `DELETE /auth/:id` — delete user (hard delete); requires `user.manage`
- `POST /auth/login` — returns JWT containing `{ sub, name, username, permissions[] }`
- `JwtAuthGuard` — validates Bearer token; attaches `{ sub, name, username, permissions[] }` to `request.user`
- JWT expiration: 8 hours
- **Route order rule**: `GET /auth/roles` must be declared before any future `GET /auth/:id` to prevent NestJS treating `"roles"` as an id param

**ThirdPartiesModule**:

- `POST /third-parties` — create a third party (customer and/or supplier); requires `thirdparty.create` permission
- `PATCH /third-parties/:id` — update; requires `thirdparty.update`
- `DELETE /third-parties/:id` — soft-delete; requires `thirdparty.delete`
- `PATCH /third-parties/:id/brands/:brandId` — rename a brand in-place; requires `thirdparty.update`
- Supports `personType`: `natural` | `juridica`
- Supports `documentType`: `CC | NIT | CE | PAS | TI | RC`
- Conditional validation: natural persons require `firstName`/`lastName`; juridical persons require `businessName`
- Optional customer fields: `creditLimit`, `discount`, `sellerId`
- Optional supplier field: `internalNumber`
- Transactional creation: ThirdParty + Customer/Supplier records in one transaction
- **Brand rules**: brands can only be added or renamed — never deleted (products reference them). `update` does `createMany` + `skipDuplicates`; frontend sends only new brands (not already in `brandIds` map). `isCustomer`/`isSupplier` are real `Boolean` columns on `ThirdParty` (`@default(false)`, indexed) set directly from the DTO in `create`/`update` — they are not derived from the presence of `customer`/`supplier` relations.

**WarehousesModule**:

- `GET /warehouses` — list all warehouses (optional `?active=true|false`); JWT required
- `GET /warehouses/:id` — detail with zones → bins hierarchy; JWT required
- `POST /warehouses` — create; requires `warehouse.manage` permission
- `PATCH /warehouses/:id` — update; requires `warehouse.manage` permission
- `DELETE /warehouses/:id` — soft-delete (`active: false`); requires `warehouse.manage` permission
- `type` is `WarehouseType` enum: `store` (almacén, sellable stock) | `warehouse` (bodega, storage only)
- Seed creates two records: `Almacén` (store) and `Bodega` (warehouse)
- Sales operations must only validate against `store`-type warehouse inventory
- Single permission `warehouse.manage` covers all write operations
- **Sub-resources (Aggregate Root pattern)**: Zone and Bin live inside WarehousesModule — no separate module. URLs: `POST /warehouses/:id/zones`, `PATCH /warehouses/:id/zones/:zoneId`, `DELETE /warehouses/:id/zones/:zoneId`, and equivalent `/bins` nested under `/zones/:zoneId/bins`. Justification: Zone/Bin have no lifecycle outside Warehouse; all endpoints require `:warehouseId` as first param.
- **Zone fields**: `name` (unique per warehouse via `@@unique([warehouseId, name])`), `active` (soft-delete)
- **Bin fields**: `code` (`Int`, numeric bin number 1..n, unique per zone via `@@unique([zoneId, code])`), `active` (soft-delete)
- **Business rules (not yet implemented)**: neither `zones.service.ts` nor `bins.service.ts` has a `remove()`/`DELETE` route today. When added, `removeZone` must verify no active bins; `removeBin` must verify `Inventory.quantity === 0`
- **findOne filter (pending — TASK 5)**: `warehouses.service.ts::findOne`'s `include` currently returns zones/bins unfiltered (no `where: { active: true }`); it must be changed to return only `active: true` zones and bins

**DocumentsModule**:

- `GET /documents` — list with filters (type, status, dateFrom, dateTo, search); requires `document.read`
- `GET /documents/:id` — detail with items, parties, warehouses; requires `document.read`
- `POST /documents` — create draft; permission checked dynamically: `document.create.{type}`
- `PATCH /documents/:id` — update draft (replaces items); same dynamic permission
- `POST /documents/:id/confirm` — apply effects (stock, kardex, accounts); same dynamic permission
- `POST /documents/:id/void` — reverse movements, delete CxP; same dynamic permission
- `DELETE /documents/:id` — delete draft only; same dynamic permission
- **Strategy pattern**: `DocumentEffectsRegistry` maps type → strategy; add new types without touching service
- **Warehouse rule**: for all types except `T`, service always resolves the active `store`-type warehouse; client never sends `warehouseId` for non-transfer docs
- **Implemented strategies (phase 1)**: `CM` (purchase), `DVC` (supplier return), `EAI` (stock adjustment in), `SAJ` (stock adjustment out), `T` (transfer)
- **BinStock population**: `BaseEffectStrategy.moveStock` upserts `BinStock` automatically whenever a `binId` is passed alongside `warehouseId`. `TransferEffectStrategy.confirm()` passes `binId` on **both** legs — `sourceBinId` on the origin/exit leg, `destBinId` on the destination/entry leg — when the respective warehouse is bin-tracked (`type: 'warehouse'`); both `validateCreate()` and `confirm()` verify each bin belongs to its stated warehouse (`Bin → Zone → Warehouse`), and `assertSufficientBinStock` guards the origin leg against insufficient bin-level stock (previously this was a known gap — the origin leg never passed `binId` — now resolved). `documents.service.ts::void()` mirrors this: when reversing a confirmed document it calls `applyBinStockChange` (not just `applyStockChange`) whenever the original movement had a `binId`, so voiding a confirmed transfer no longer leaves phantom stock in the source/dest bin — that gap used to silently break the `SUM(BinStock)===Inventory` invariant (Safety Rule). See `plans/007-binstock-traslados-inventario-real.md` (gitignored, local) for the broader gap analysis against the real warehouse inventory (talla, unidad de medida, carga masiva) — blocked on a stakeholder meeting.
- **Phase 2 types** (not yet implemented): `COT`, `POS`, `DVV`, `REM`, `RMDVC`, `PE` — each needs only a new Strategy class
- **Per-type cost UI in `ProductRow.tsx`** (frontend): `SAJ` never lets the user type a cost — `SajEffectStrategy` always uses the product's live `avgCost`, so the form shows it as read-only text (with a copy-to-clipboard button, for manually re-entering that exact value into a follow-up `EAI`) instead of an input. `EAI`'s cost is optional and, when typed, re-weights `avgCost` — a client-side warning (amber, non-blocking) fires if the typed cost deviates >30% from the product's current `avgCost`, since that pattern usually means a digit was dropped, not a real cost change. `CM`/`DVC` show a plain required cost input. Manually moving a product's full cost basis from one product to another (`SAJ` on the source + `EAI` on the destination) requires the operator to type the source's real `avgCost` into the destination `EAI` — there's no atomic "merge product" operation yet; see `plans/007-...` context and `tasks/pendiente-mejoras-operativas.md` (gitignored) for the fuller writeup.
- **`SAJ`/`T` never persist `unitCost`/`subtotal` on `DocumentItem`** — their strategies only read the product's `avgCost` for the kardex movement, they never write a cost back onto the item (unlike `CM`/`DVC`/`EAI`, which do). `DocumentDetailPage.tsx` accounts for this: for those two types it derives `unitCost`/`subtotal` live from `item.product.avgCost` (`usesAvgCostFallback`) instead of reading the always-zero `item.unitCost`/`item.subtotal` fields, and labels the column "Costo unit. (prom.)" instead of the plain "Costo unit." to signal it's a live average, not a transactional cost. Requires `product.avgCost` to be included in `DocumentsService`'s `DETAIL_INCLUDE` — if a future query drops that field, this silently reverts to showing "—".

**AccountsPayableModule**:

- `GET /accounts-payable` — list paginated, filters by `status`/`supplierId`/`search` (supplier name); requires `ap.read`
- `GET /accounts-payable/:id` — detail with `supplier.thirdParty`, `document`, `payablePayments` (desc); requires `ap.read`
- `POST /accounts-payable/:id/payments` — register a payment; requires `ap.manage`. Runs in `$transaction`, opens with `SELECT id FROM accounts_payable WHERE id = $1 FOR UPDATE` to serialize concurrent payments against the same account (prevents overpayment from a race), validates payment doesn't exceed pending balance (compared in integer cents via `toCents()` to avoid float drift), recomputes `status` (`pending` | `partial` | `paid`)
- Created automatically by `CM`/`DVC` document strategies on confirm; deleted on void (blocked if it already has payments)

**AccountsReceivableModule**:

- Mirrors `AccountsPayableModule` exactly, client side instead of supplier side — same endpoints (`GET /accounts-receivable`, `GET /accounts-receivable/:id`, `POST /accounts-receivable/:id/payments`), same `$transaction` + cents-based balance validation pattern + `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row lock, requires `ar.read` / `ar.manage`
- **Schema differences from AccountsPayable — do not copy blindly**: `AccountsReceivable` has two party relations (`client` via `Customer.thirdParty`, and `seller` via `ThirdParty` directly, relation name `SellerAR`) instead of AP's single `supplier`; `ReceivablePayment` has no `bankDestination` field (AP's `PayablePayment` does)
- Not yet wired to any document strategy (sales document types `COT`/`POS`/`DVV` are still Phase 2 — see DocumentsModule below), so records currently must be created manually until those strategies exist

**CommonModule** (`src/common/`):

- `decorators/permissions.decorator.ts` — `@Permissions(...perms)` sets required permissions via SetMetadata
- `decorators/public.decorator.ts` — `@Public()` marks a route as unauthenticated (skips JWT guard)
- `guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts` — global guard (registered via `APP_GUARD` in `AppModule`); checks `IS_PUBLIC_KEY` via Reflector before validating Bearer token; throws 401 on failure
- `guards/permissions.guard.ts` — global guard (registered via `APP_GUARD`); checks `request.user.permissions` against required perms, throws 403 if missing. `@Permissions` can be placed at class level (applies to all methods) or method level (overrides class)
- `filters/prisma-exception.filter.ts` — maps Prisma errors to HTTP responses (Spanish messages)
- `interceptors/response-format.interceptor.ts` — wraps responses as `{ success: true, data: T }`
- `enums/index.ts` — exports `MovementType`, `DocumentType`, `DocumentStatus`
- `types/index.ts` — exports `JwtPayload`, `RequestWithUser`, `ResponseFormat<T>`

### Authentication & Authorization

JWT includes the user's full permission set (loaded from Role → RolePermission → Permission at login time). Guards check against this in-token permissions array — no per-request DB lookup needed.

RBAC roles defined in seed: `admin`, `purchasing`, `warehouse`, `basket_management`, `billing`, `accounts_payable_admin`, `accounts_receivable_admin`.

Permissions are namespaced by module: `products.*`, `documents.*`, `warehouses.*`, `third_parties.*`, `accounts.*`, `cash.*`, `users.*`, `labels.*`.

### Database (Prisma + PostgreSQL)

Schema: `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`. Uses `@prisma/adapter-pg` for connection pooling.

Key domain models and their relationships:

- **ThirdParty** → base for `Customer` and `Supplier` (one-to-one)
- **Product** — has pricing (`salePrice`, `minSalePrice`) and costing (`avgCost`, `lastCost`). No stock cache field — stock is always queried from `Inventory`. `unitOfMeasure` (`unidad` | `docena`, default `unidad`) is **purely informational** — it does not multiply/convert quantity anywhere; it only surfaces as a label in the transfer (`T`) document item row (`ProductRow.tsx`) so the operator knows how that product is physically counted. A full docena↔unidad conversion system is still blocked on the stakeholder meeting referenced in `plans/007-binstock-traslados-inventario-real.md` (gitignored, local) — don't assume `unitOfMeasure` implies any calculation exists.
- **Warehouse → Zone → Bin** — three-level location hierarchy. `Warehouse.type` is a `WarehouseType` enum (`store` | `warehouse`). `GET /warehouses/:id` computes a non-persisted `occupied: boolean` per bin (`SUM(BinStock.quantity) > 0` for that bin) — the frontend's transfer destination-bin selector (`DocumentFormPage.tsx`) filters to `occupied === false` only, since a bin ("bulto") is a reusable physical container that shouldn't receive a second transfer while it still holds stock from a prior one. This is deliberately NOT a mutable schema field (no manual "usado/libre" toggle) — it's always derived live from `BinStock` so it can never drift out of sync; it becomes available again automatically once its stock is fully moved out. The warehouse admin UI (`DetailPanel.tsx`) still lists all bins regardless of `occupied`.
- **Inventory** — current stock per `(productId, warehouseId)` composite PK. `quantity` is `Int`. Query this table for stock totals (used by sales/POS). Never cache on Product.
- **BinStock** — bin-level stock per `(productId, binId)` composite PK. Has denormalized `warehouseId` to avoid 3-level JOIN. Only populated by transfer documents (type `T`). Purchases (CM) only update `Inventory` — all incoming stock enters the warehouse without bin assignment. Invariant: `SUM(BinStock.quantity WHERE warehouseId=W) === Inventory.quantity WHERE warehouseId=W`.
- **InventoryMovement** — append-only audit trail; `type` enum: `purchase | sale | return | transfer | adjustment | initial_stock | void | production`. `quantity`, `previousStock`, `newStock` are `Int`.
- **DocumentItem** — `quantity` is `Int`. Costs/prices (`unitCost`, `unitPrice`, `subtotal`) remain `Decimal`.
- **Document + DocumentItem** — unified transaction document supporting types: `CM, DVC, RMDVC, PE, EAI, SAJ, COT, POS, REM, DVV, T`
- **AccountsReceivable / AccountsPayable** — payment tracking with credit support
- **User → UserRole → Role → RolePermission → Permission** — full RBAC graph

### Conventions

- **Path alias**: `@/*` maps to `src/*` (configured in `tsconfig.json`). Verified working at build time: `nest build`'s compiler resolves `@/` to relative paths in the emitted `dist/` output, so it's safe at runtime too. **Import rule (hybrid — matches `import/no-relative-parent-imports`, Airbnb/Google style guides): use `@/` only when the import would otherwise need to go up a directory (`../`). Same-directory or subdirectory-of-current-directory imports (`./create-x.dto`, `./strategies/index`) stay relative.** This keeps modules portable (movable without rewriting their internal imports) and preserves `./` as a signal of "lives right next to me" vs `@/` as "cross-cutting dependency from elsewhere in the app." Example: `documents/dto/index.ts` re-exporting `./create-document.dto` stays relative (same folder); a file needing something from `common/` two levels up uses `@/common/x` instead of `../../common/x`.
- **Response format**: Always `{ success: boolean, data: T }` — the interceptor handles wrapping; `message` is optional
- **Error messages**: Spanish language (matches existing filter messages)
- **Passwords**: bcrypt, 10 salt rounds
- **Config**: All secrets via `ConfigService` from `.env` (`DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`)

## Frontend (EloSC)

### Commands

All commands run from the `frontend/` directory using `pnpm`.

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start Vite dev server
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm preview      # Preview production build
pnpm lint         # ESLint
```

### Testing frontend changes

When verifying any frontend behavior end-to-end (forms, flows, bug fixes), use the **Playwright CLI in headed mode** — write an ad-hoc script using the `playwright` package already installed in `frontend/` (`chromium.launch({ headless: false })`) and run it with `node`. Not the chrome-devtools MCP tools, not headless. The user wants to see the browser window while the flow runs.

### Key Patterns

**API responses** — Backend wraps everything as `{ success, data: T }`. Services unwrap before returning:
```ts
const res = await api.get<ApiResponse<T>>('/endpoint', { params })
return res.data.data
```

**Queries** — Always include `staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000` to avoid redundant refetches on cached keys. Use `keepPreviousData` on paginated/searchable lists to prevent flicker.

**Debounced search** — 400 ms debounce via `useEffect` + `setTimeout`; reset `page` to 1 when search changes.

**Pagination** — Backend returns `{ items, meta: { total, page, limit, totalPages } }`. Query key includes `[..., page]`. Pagination controls show ellipsis for large page counts.

**Mutations** — Always call `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['resource'] })` on success.

**Logout dropdown** — Built with `useState` + `useRef` + `document.addEventListener('mousedown', ...)` for click-outside detection. No external library.

**Row click to edit** — Every list page `<tr>` must have `onClick={() => setEditing(item)}` and `cursor-pointer`. The delete button must call `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent bubbling. The pencil button also gets `e.stopPropagation()` (it becomes redundant but keeps explicitness). Apply this pattern to every new module.

**Protected routes** — `AuthGuard` checks `useAuthStore` token; redirects to `/login` if not authenticated.

**Combobox (shared)** — Use `<Combobox>` from `@/components/shared` for all searchable dropdowns. Two modes: (1) **Controlled** — pass `searchValue`/`onSearchChange` for server-side debounce; show "Escribe para buscar..." when empty, let caller manage `enabled` on the query; (2) **Uncontrolled** — omit both props, component filters `options` client-side. Always uses `createPortal` → safe inside overflow containers. Option interface: `{ id, label, sublabel? }`. `onChange` signature: `(id: string, option: ComboboxOption) => void`. For server-side search, add a synthetic option when an item is already selected and search is empty (prevents the trigger showing blank). It has no keyboard support (no Enter-to-select, no arrow-key nav) — every selection is mouse-only; that's why the barcode-scan flow (see `frontend/src/pages/documents/CLAUDE.md`) needed its own dedicated input instead of reusing it.

**`minSalePrice` auto-fill** — `ProductForm.tsx` auto-computes "Precio mínimo de venta" as `salePrice * 0.98` (business rule: 2% floor discount) while creating a product, live as `salePrice` is typed. Stops overwriting the moment the user edits `minSalePrice` by hand (tracked via a `minSalePriceTouched` flag, reset on every form open) — never auto-fills in edit mode, only on create.

**Permission-based UI** — Use `usePermission(...perms)` from `@/hooks/usePermission` to show/hide UI elements. The JWT already carries `permissions[]` so no extra request is needed. Pattern:
```tsx
const canManage = usePermission('user.manage')
// Hide action buttons, sidebar sections, entire CTAs:
{canManage && <button>Nuevo usuario</button>}
```
For sidebar sections that must be hidden for some roles, render the `<NavLink>` conditionally inside the component (not in the static `navGroups` array). See `Sidebar.tsx` "Administración" section as reference.

**Sidebar accordion nav items** — When a nav section needs collapsible sub-items (e.g. Bodegas), create a dedicated component (`WarehousesSidebarItem`) instead of a static NavLink. Use `useLocation` + `useState` for open/close; `max-height` CSS transition for animation; `useQuery` to load sub-items from API. Sub-item links use `Link` (not `NavLink`) with manual `isActive` computed from `location.search` — React Router's NavLink `isActive` ignores query params and would mark all sub-items active simultaneously.

**Lazy route loading** — `router/index.tsx`'s `Lazy` wrapper uses a `DelayedPageLoader` (200ms `setTimeout` before rendering `PageLoader`) as the `Suspense` fallback, not `PageLoader` directly. Route chunks that resolve faster than 200ms (already-loaded chunks, fast dev-server reloads) never show the full-screen loader — only genuinely slow loads do. Don't revert this to a bare `<PageLoader />` fallback; it reintroduces a flash on every navigation.

**Theme toggle animation** — `Header.tsx`'s theme button uses the View Transition API (`document.startViewTransition`) for an expanding-circle wipe, with a plain `toggleTheme()` fallback when unsupported. Three gotchas if touching this: (1) wrap the state update in `flushSync` inside the transition callback — the `.dark` class toggle in `AppLayout.tsx`'s `useEffect` must apply synchronously before the browser snapshots the new state; (2) `index.css` resets `mix-blend-mode: normal` on `::view-transition-old(root)`/`::view-transition-new(root)` — Chrome's default `plus-lighter` blend additively mixes the two layers during a clip-path reveal, producing a color-flash; (3) the reveal keyframe animation needs `fill-mode: forwards`, otherwise `clip-path` snaps back to `circle(0%)` the instant the animation ends, flashing the old theme for a frame.

**Role display names** — Spanish labels for roles live in `users.service.ts` as `ROLE_LABELS: Record<string, string>` with a `getRoleLabel(name)` helper that falls back to `replace(/_/g, ' ')`. Import from there when displaying role names anywhere in the UI.

### Implemented Modules

| Route | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `/login` | Done | JWT auth, redirects to `/` if already logged in |
| `/` (dashboard) | Partial | Stats cards — Terceros shows real count, rest are static `—` |
| `/third-parties` | Done | Full CRUD, server-side search, debounce, pagination, cache |
| `/products` | Done | Full CRUD, server-side search, debounce, pagination, cache, stock column (total + per-warehouse breakdown), cost columns ("Costo Prom." / "Últ. Costo") |
| `/warehouses` | Partial | Full CRUD warehouses + zones/bins (backend controllers implemented); sidebar accordion shows sub-items per warehouse; URL-based selection via `?id=` |
| `/documents` | Done | List + form (create/edit/confirm/void), portal Combobox, search-on-type |
| `/users` | Done | Full CRUD, role checkboxes, password confirmation, permission-gated sidebar |
| `/accounts-receivable` | Placeholder | ComingSoonPage |
| `/accounts-payable` | Placeholder | ComingSoonPage |

### Design Tokens

All colors and gradients are tokenized — **never use hardcoded hex values** in components.

**Color classes** (defined in `src/index.css` `@theme`):
- `bg-brand-primary` / `text-brand-primary` — `#141a17` (sidebar, dark surfaces)
- `bg-brand-secondary` / `text-brand-secondary` — `#07bc34` (CTAs, active states)
- `bg-brand-surface` — `#1e2820` (dropdowns on dark backgrounds)
- `bg-brand-primary-dark` — `#0d1210` (page background on login)
- Opacity modifiers work natively: `bg-brand-secondary/10`, `bg-brand-primary/15`

**Gradient utilities** (use as className, never as inline `style`):
- `gradient-action` — green CTA: buttons, active pagination
- `gradient-dark` — dark surface: empty state icons
- `gradient-user` — user avatars: dark-to-green
- `nav-active` — sidebar active NavLink
- `glass` — glassmorphism for dark panel forms
- `text-gradient-brand` — green gradient text for hero copy

### Typography

Fonts loaded in `index.html` from Google Fonts. Applied globally via `@layer base` in `src/index.css`.

| Font | Weight | Applied to | Class |
|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Prompt | Black 900 | h1–h6 (automatic) | — |
| Barlow | Regular 400 | Body text (default) | `font-sans` |
| Barlow | Medium Italic 500 | Subtitles, supporting text | `font-accent` |

**Rule:** Do not add `font-bold` to headings — Prompt Black is applied automatically. Use `font-accent` for subtitle/description text (e.g., page subtitles, date labels, placeholder descriptions).

### UI Conventions

- Error messages in **Spanish** (matches backend)
- Toast pattern: `toast.success` / `toast.error` / `toast.info` (Sonner)
- All stats show `animate-pulse` skeleton while loading, never blank/undefined
- Action buttons hidden (`opacity-0`) on table rows, revealed on `group-hover`
- Path alias `@/*` → `src/*` (same as backend). **Import rule (hybrid — matches `import/no-relative-parent-imports`, Airbnb/Google style guides): use `@/` only when the import would otherwise need to go up a directory (`../`). Same-directory or subdirectory-of-current-directory imports (`./components/X`, `./x.constants`) stay relative.** This keeps feature folders portable (movable without rewriting their internal imports) and preserves `./` as a signal of "lives right next to me" vs `@/` as "cross-cutting dependency from elsewhere in the app." Example: `pages/accounts-payable/AccountsPayableDetailPage.tsx` importing its own `./components/StatusBadge` stays relative; that same component reaching up one level for `../accounts-payable.constants` becomes `@/pages/accounts-payable/accounts-payable.constants` instead.

### Shared Components

`components/shared/` contains reusable primitives for all list/table pages. **Always import from the barrel** `@/components/shared`, never from individual files.

```tsx
// ✅ correct
import { Combobox, StatsGrid, TableToolbar, TableSkeleton, EmptyState, ErrorState, TablePagination } from '@/components/shared'

// ❌ wrong — bypasses barrel
import { StatsGrid } from '@/components/shared/StatsGrid'
```

| Component | Key props | Use when |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| `Combobox` | `value`, `onChange(id, opt)`, `options: ComboboxOption[]`, `searchValue?`, `onSearchChange?`, `isLoading?`, `placeholder?`, `disabled?`, `error?` | Searchable dropdown. Controlled mode (pass `searchValue`/`onSearchChange`) for server-side debounce; uncontrolled (omit both) for small client-side datasets. Uses `createPortal` — safe inside overflow containers. |
| `StatsGrid` | `cards: StatCard[]`, `isLoading` | 3-card stat row at top of every list page |
| `TableToolbar` | `search`, `onSearchChange`, `placeholder`, `isLoading`, `itemCount`, `total`, `onRefresh` | Search + count + refresh bar above table |
| `TableSkeleton` | `rows?`, `widths: [w1, w2, w3, w4]` | Animated placeholder while data loads |
| `EmptyState` | `icon`, `title`, `description` | No-data / no-results state inside table |
| `ErrorState` | `message`, `onRetry` | Fetch error state inside table |
| `TablePagination` | `page`, `totalPages`, `total`, `onPageChange` | Footer pagination; auto-hides if `totalPages ≤ 1` |
| `PageLoader` | — | Full-page branded loading spinner |

**Rule:** Before writing inline skeleton, error state, empty state, stats grid, toolbar, pagination, or searchable combobox in a new page — check this list first and use the shared component.

**Component splitting rule** — Extract an inline component when: (a) it exceeds ~100 lines AND has a clearly differentiable responsibility, OR (b) it's duplicated in 2+ files. Do NOT extract when: it's <50 lines and used only once, or when extraction adds more indirection than clarity. Helpers that are just styled wrappers (~10-15 lines) stay inline. Pages >600 lines should be reviewed for extractable sections.

### Dark Mode — MANDATORY for every new component

The app has a dark/light toggle. **Every component must be dark-mode-ready from the start.** The rule is simple: never use hardcoded Tailwind gray classes. Use semantic tokens instead.

| Instead of… | Use… |
|-------------|------|
| `bg-white` | `bg-surface` |
| `bg-gray-50` (elevated area, toolbar, footer) | `bg-surface-raised` |
| `bg-gray-100` (hover state, skeleton) | `bg-surface-hover` |
| `hover:bg-gray-50` | `hover:bg-surface-raised` |
| `hover:bg-gray-100` | `hover:bg-surface-hover` |
| `border-gray-50` / `divide-gray-50` | `border-ui-divide` / `divide-ui-divide` |
| `border-gray-100` | `border-ui-border` |
| `border-gray-200` | `border-ui-border-medium` |
| `text-gray-900` / `text-gray-800` | `text-content` |
| `text-gray-700` / `text-gray-600` | `text-content-secondary` |
| `text-gray-500` | `text-content-muted` |
| `text-gray-400` / `text-gray-300` | `text-content-faint` |
| `bg-gray-50` (page background) | `bg-page` |

**Inline styles with hex colors are forbidden.** Replace with CSS utility classes:
- `style={{ background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #141a17, #1f2b24)' }}` → `className="gradient-dark"`
- `style={{ background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #07bc34, #059928)' }}` → `className="gradient-action"`
- `style={{ background: '#141a17' }}` → `className="bg-brand-primary"`

**Status / category pill badges** use Tailwind color classes (green, blue, amber…) which are acceptable, but must include dark-mode variants:
```tsx
// ✅ correct
'bg-green-100 text-green-700 dark:bg-green-500/20 dark:text-green-400'

// ❌ wrong — no dark variant
'bg-green-100 text-green-700'
```

The `dark:` variant works because `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *))` is declared in `index.css` and `<html class="dark">` is toggled by `useThemeStore` via `AppLayout`.

## Routing Rules

Defines when to delegate to a subagent or invoke a skill. **Read the trigger condition; if it matches, invoke that tool BEFORE generating any response.** Triggers are written en lenguaje natural — reconocer la intención aunque la frase exacta difiera.

### Subagents

| Trigger | Subagent | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Cualquier implementación de frontend: crear O modificar páginas, componentes, hooks, features, formularios, tablas, secciones — "hazme una página de…", "agrega el módulo de…", "necesito la pantalla de…", "crea el form para…", "arregla el bug en…", "cambia el componente de…", "edita la tabla de…", "modifica el form de…" | `react-code-crafter` | Invocar skill `vercel-react-best-practices` ANTES de lanzar el agente, e incluir las reglas relevantes en el prompt.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
